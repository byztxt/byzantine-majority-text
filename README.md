![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/ByzTxt/byzantine-majority-text?style=for-the-badge)

## What is this?

This is the official GitHub home for [Dr. Maurice A. Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_A._Robinson)'s Greek
texts with morphological parsing and Strong's numbers.

This repo contains the Robinson-Pierpont edition of the Greek New
Testament in the Original Greek, Byzantine Majority Text, 2005 edition.

The 2005 edition of the text can be freely downloaded as a PDF file from The Internet Archive [here](https://archive.org/details/newtestamentrobinsonpierpontbyzantine/).

Five versions are available:

1. A parsed version in Online Bible format with morphological parsing codes, Strong's numbers, and tense-voice-mood numbers.

2. A "text only" version in Online Bible ASCII format.

3. A "text only" version in something akin to BETA Code, with accents, breathings, diarheses, iota subscripts, Byzantine variants, and
a Nestle-Aland 27 collation.

4. Unicode versions in CSV format. These files can be found in the `csv-unicode` folder (see the `README` file there for more information.)

5. TEI-XML versions (in the `tei-xml-unicode` folder) created according to the [IGNTP guidelines for XML transcriptions of New Testament manuscripts using the TEI P5 (version 1.5)](http://epapers.bham.ac.uk/1892/5/IGNTP_XML_guidelines_1-5.pdf) (see the `README` file in the folder for more information). These files are directly collatable, using the [CollateX](https://collatex.net/) software, with the [Münster INTF transcriptions](https://ntvmr.uni-muenster.de/home) of the manuscripts used in the *Editio Critica Maior*.
