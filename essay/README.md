# The case for Byzantine priority

This folder contains the text of the "The case for Byzantine priority" essay, written by professor Maurice A. Robinson. There are two versions, one in English (which was kindly provided by Daniel Mount as a Word document and then converted to Markdown) and one in Spanish (which was translated by Norman S. Rodriguez). Both versions are in the Public Domain.

The essay is presented as Markdown files with the `.qmd` extension, which means that they can be opened and converted using the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) software package. You can open the files with [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (install RStudio and double click on the `essay.Rproj` file, then open the `.qmd` files in RStudio) to easily convert them to a variety of formats, including Word, LaTeX, Html, etc. As they are Markdown files, they can also be converted with [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and can be opened using any text editor.

The original essay in PDF format in English can be accessed [here](https://archive.org/details/newtestamentrobinsonpierpontbyzantine) (at the end of the book). The original PDF version of the Spanish translation can be found [here](https://archive.org/details/libro-robinson-traducido/LIBRO%20ROBINSON%20TRADUCIDO/).

**Note:** Please note that the [overlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overline) in the Greek *nomina sacra* do not appear in the Markdown versions due to the typographical limitations of the Markdown language, although they are present in the PDF versions.
